       <p>I was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland. Upon graduation from high school, I moved to Alabama
       to attend Tuskegee University as a pre-med biology major. It was there that I joined Air Force ROTC
       becoming completely immersed in aviation. Deciding that I would pursue a civillian career in aviation, I returned to Maryland
       to study aviation management. It was then that I began flying small single-engine aircraft. I loved every
       minute of it! After nearly a decade of working in aviation, I am called to tech.</p>
       <p>My first taste of coding came when I randomly decided to build an air traffic control simulator to help my peers study
       for the AT-SAT (a standardized test administered to air traffic control students to access their job qualification level). 
       There weren't any practice simulators available so I challenged myself to build one. With absolutely no experience or 
       prior coding knowledge, I completed the simulator in just 30 days using canvas,
        HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Busy with my aviaiton studies, I turned my focus back to school and my coding journey ended there... or so I thought.</p>
       <p>Over the next eight years, I worked for an airline and 
       traveled all over the world taking pictures. Naturally, I moved on to videography shooting weddings and promo videos for businesses. As you
       can probably tell by now, I am driven by relentless curiosity, an insatiable thrist for knowledge and the thrill of a good challenge.
       Mastering highly technical subjects and solving complex problems are my thing. Software development
       seemed like a perfect fit for me. While aviation will always have a place near to my heart, a career in software development 
       provides me with the ability to directly impact lives while challenging myself. I am extremely excited to land my first job as a developer and complete my transition!</p>
      <p>These days, I live in Baltimore with my cat, Tituba, and dog, Kesh. In my freetime, I enjoy cooking, antiquing, golfing, 
         traveling and flying my drone.</p>
